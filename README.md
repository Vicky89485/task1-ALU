In this task, I designed and simulated a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU supports five operations: addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. I created a separate testbench module to verify each operation by applying different input combinations. After simulation, I captured and analyzed the waveform to ensure correct functionality of all operations. The design and testbench code are stored in my GitHub repository along with simulation screenshots.
